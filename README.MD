# Maryland Youth and Government Database Application

This project was created for my Database class, it works with a preexisting database that requires VPN access to Towson University's network as well as my Database Username and Password. Im not willing to provide access to these things but I think the source code could be helpful to anyone interested in creating a beginner GUI based Database Java Application.
